# Exercises for chapter 2: Problems 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 in Think Python

# Maurice Rahmey

# 2.1: The numbers that start with a 0 are showing up wrong because the computer believes these are not binary numbers.

# 2.2: The output when x = 5 and x + 1 is run as a script is 6. When a print statement is put before expressions, the outputs are 5 and 6.
# print 5
# x = 5
# print x + 1

# 2.3: 
# 1) width/2 = 8 | int
# 2) width/2.0 = 8.5 | float
# 3) height/3 = 4.0 | float
# 4) 1 + 2 * 5 = 11 | int
# 5) delimiter * 5 = '.....' | str

# 2.4:
# 1) 523.3333333333334
	# pi = 3.14
	# r = 5.0
	# 4.0/3.0*pi*r**3
# 2) 945.45
	# (24.95*0.6*60+0.75*(60-1)+3
# 3) 7:30
	# begin = (6*60+52)*60
	# easy = (8*60+15)*2
	# fast = (7*60+12)*3
	# end = (begin + easy + fast)/(60*60.0)
	# endHour = int(end)
	# endMinute  = (end - endHour)*60
	# print '%d:%d' % (endHour,endMinute)
